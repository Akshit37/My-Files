## Financial Report

Hello Everyone, 
I made this Finance Dashboard in Power BI with the sample Finance dataset. 

## Problem Statement

The goal of this Power BI Dashboard project is to evaluate a company's financial performance by utilizing the provided sample financial data. The dashboard aims to:
* Present an interactive and visually engaging overview of key financial metrics such as profit, expenses, revenue, discounts, and profit margins.
* Enable stakeholders to analyze trends in monthly performance, product-wise and segment-wise discounts, and product profit margins.

## Sections in the Dashboard

This Power BI Dashboard is designed to provide an interactive and insightful way to explore financial data. Hereâ€™s what it offers:
* Filter Options: Easily slice data by Country, or Month to focus on particular data.
* Key Metrics at a Glance: Cards at the top display total units sold, profit, and expenses, giving a quick performance overview.
* Monthly Trends: An area chart shows how profits change month-to-month, while a line chart compares revenue and expenses over time.
* Product and Segment Insights: Pie charts reveal how discounts are distributed across products and segments, while bar charts highlight profit margins by product.
